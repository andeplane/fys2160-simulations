# Gas thermodynamics

The ideal gas is a theoretical idealisation that is valid for gases at low pressure and density. In this exercise you will do experiments to probe the range of validity of the _ideal gas model_ and the _degrees of freedom_ of the gases. You have two types of instruments at your disposal to do experiments,

* _Lammps MD simulator_ that can be used to measure the _compressibility_ and the _heat capacity_ in three model gases:
  * atomic LJ
  * diatomic LJ with spring bond 
  * diatomic LJ with stiff bond
* _Kundt's tube_ that measures the  _speed of sound_ in three physical gases:
  * air
  * CO$_2$
  * argon

## The objective of this lab is to find answers to the following questions:

* When can we consider a real gas to be ideal?
* In what range of pressures, densities and temperatures are the deviations from ideality negligible? (What is "negligible"?)
* In which sense can molecular gases be considered ideal gases?
* Can we model the deviation from ideal behaviour?
* Do the MD model predictions agree with experiments?

You can explore this ``unstructured problem formulation'' in the way you want to. If you find this too difficult, we have formulated some more structured ``tasks''. In both cases: in order to answer the questions well you will have to analyse your results as you go and refine your physical and numerical experiments.

# Introduction

This weeks exercise will help you get ready for the lab next week.

## Studying molecular models

The simplest model of a molecule is that atoms are represented by indivisible mathematical points _(rigid balls)_ without ``personality" (i.e., no other physically measurable attributes).

In the _ideal gas_ model atoms do not interact. For ideal gases we have a very direct bridge between micro- and macro-physics, via the equation of state. For an ideal gas the _equation of state_ is

$p V = nkT=n_{\rm mol} R T,$

where $n_{\rm mol}$ is the amount of matter measured in the SI unit $mol$.
The number of moles of gas molecules is $n_{mol}  = m/M_{\rm mol} = N/N_A$,
where $m$ is the mass of the gas, $M_{\rm mol}$ is the mass of one mole of the gas 
(the _molar mass_), $N$ is the number of molecules in the gas, and $N_A$ is Avogadro's number. 


## Compressibility factor

Rearranging the ideal gas equation of state in terms of the compressibility factor, $Z=\frac{pV}{nkT}=1$, we can express deviations from the ideal gas model in terms of the virial expansion.

$Z=\frac{pV}{nkT}=1+B\rho+C\rho^2+...,$


where $\rho=n/V$ and $B$ and $C$ are the virial coefficients. This virial expansion is a macroscopic model equation of state that takes into account that the molecules have finite size and interact.
A positive second virial coefficient signifies that the final size of the molecules and repulsive interactions between them dominate a negative $B$ signifies that the attractive interactions between the molecules dominate.

##  Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution

In section 6.3 of Schroeder he derives the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution of an ideal gas. In this short exercise you will measure the speed distribution of a Lennard-Jones liquid and solid and compare them to the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution.
